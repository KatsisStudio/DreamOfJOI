You begin to feel sleepy.
Very...very sleepy.
You struggle to keep in control, but as your mind grows foggy
Your body gets hotter...and hotter...
You see a person standing in front of you, a woman?
She giggles while approaching you 
Oh my, what to we have here? Someone fell in my trap, you are gonna be so useful for my investigation ~ 
Now.. Be nice and obey me ~
You can sense a sweet smell.. You can't take your eyes out of her
